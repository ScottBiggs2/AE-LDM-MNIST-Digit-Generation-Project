# AE-LDM-MNIST-Digit-Generation-Project
A project dedicated to mirroring the architecture I'm pursuing in my research group at Northeastern University's EAI. Using an Autoencoder to access latent representations as well as to decode them, and a LDM model to generate new latent spaces from random noise to then generate new digit images. Finally getting around to cleaning up this project and putting it here.
